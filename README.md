golang-uci-functions-methods-interfaces
=======================================

I already have [another repository containing Go
code](https://github.com/mwoitek/golang-uci-getting-started). The files in that
repo correspond to solutions to programming assignments of an on-line course on
golang. This course has a second part, which I also completed. To do so, I had
to finish four more assignments. Their solutions are here.
